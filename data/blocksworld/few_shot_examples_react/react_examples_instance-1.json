            "My goal is that in the end object_2 is on object_1\nI: My current initial situation is as follows: \nThere are 4 objects: object_0, object_1, object_2, object_3\nCurrently, object_0 is clear, object_0 is on the table, object_1 is clear, object_1 is on object_2, object_2 is on the table, object_3 is clear, object_3 is on the table, the hand is empty\nYou:\n\tThink: Object_1 is not clear because it is on object_2, and I need object_1 to be clear to stack object_2 on it. I must unstack object_1 from object_2 first.\n\tInstruction: unstack object object_1 from object object_2\nI: I unstack object object_1 from object object_2.\nYou:\n\tThink: Now that object_1 has been unstacked, I need to put it down to free my hand so I can pick up object_2.\n\tInstruction: put down object object_1\nI: I put down object object_1.\nYou:\n\tThink: With object_1 on the table and my hand empty, I can now pick up object_2 since it is clear and on the table.\n\tInstruction: pick up object object_2 from the table with an empty hand\nI: I pick up object object_2 from the table with an empty hand.\nYou:\n\tThink: Now that object_2 is being held, I can stack it on object_1, which is clear and on the table, to achieve the goal of object_2 being on object_1.\n\tInstruction: stack object object_2 on object object_1\nI: I stack object object_2 on object object_1.\nYou:\n\tThink: object_2 is on object_1\n\tInstruction: You are finished.\nI: Great!",
